    Following the 2012–13 winter break, Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first
         time in an official match, scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad 
         on 6 January.[165] He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to 
         captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January, a match which also marked his 500th club appearance.
         [166] Three days prior, he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe.[167] He scored his 200th g
         oal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga, reaching the landmark in 197 games.
         [168] He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico,
          which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored,[169] a club record.
          [160] In the final, he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 extra time defeat to Atlético, 
          but was shown a red card for violent conduct.[170] In the first knockout round of the Champions League,
           Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time.
            After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home,[171] he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on
             his first return to Old Trafford.[172] He did not celebrate scoring against his former club 
             as a mark of respect.[173] After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters, 
             he scored Madrid's only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals 
             and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite
              a 2–0 win in the second leg.[174]</p>
